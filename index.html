			<br>
			<div class="info-text">These scenarios are:
				<ul>
					<li>A Cell dies if it has 0 or 1 neighbor, it starves</li>
					<li>A Cell dies if it has 4 or more neighbors, it's over-populated</li>
					<li>A Cell is reborn if it has exactly 3 living neighbors, it's magic</li>
				</ul>
				While the game is not running, feel free to edit the cells by clicking them.
